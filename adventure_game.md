The mighty Celadon opened the chest and grabbed the old engrvaved book.
He deliberately opened a random page and read:
    When the moon covered the sun, the Valiant Explorer of the Soul gathered 
    three mystic crystals and presented them to his master before midnight.
Celadon stared at the infinite space in front of him.

Suddenly, he closed the book and looked at you:
    Are you the Valiant Explorer of the Soul ? (Y, N)
    Yes: Indeed! There is no time to waste. Find the three crystals before midnight
    No: Coward! Leave this tent and never come back !

You walk/run out of the tent and look at the bright blue sky.
